She refused to come to the telephone and her husband explains that she doesnt answer the phone as she doesnt like not knowing who is calling and what they are asking for.  She doesnt do very much around the house and this has gotten worse since May.  He does not think he could bring her next year to St Louis for a visit.

Sent the registered letter in October which came back to me as it was never picked up from the post office.  Received an email on 12/12/16 that she would not be returning to DIAN as she is so busy with her four daughters. I emailed her a copy of the letter so she knows she can call us if She ever decides to return.",,,,5,4,12,,1,08/04/2015,Re-monitored by LSwisher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,48,1,-1,4,180,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,60,0,0,ePrime,63,10,8,10,13,11,11,71,13,12,13,10,7,16,64,8,11,14,9,11,11,99,14,18,18,20,15,14,99,15,15,17,20,16,16,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,1,5,3,3,3,4,4,4,3,2,1,5,3,3,2,3,4,3,4,3,3,3,2,4,1,4,3,2,2,3,1,3,3,4,4,5,5,4,3,4,1,5,3,2,3,3,2,4,3,2,4,2,2,3,2,4,4,1,2,3,1,2,2,3,3,2,3,3,2,3,1,1,3,1,3,2,1,2,5,3,2,2,3,3,2,3,4,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,2,1,1,4,4,4,1,1,4,1,3,1,1,4,4,3,3,1,0,ePrime,71,16,8,12,14,8,13,79,18,11,10,14,8,18,55,6,11,16,8,8,6,112,16,20,20,19,20,17,102,12,20,20,19,15,16,5,5,3,4,4,1,1,2,1,5,2,2,2,5,5,3,5,2,1,5,1,3,2,1,1,3,3,1,4,3,4,3,1,5,3,3,2,4,1,1,4,3,4,5,5,5,5,5,2,4,5,3,5,1,4,4,5,1,3,1,2,1,1,4,2,2,1,3,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,2,1,4,1,1,2,1,3,1,1,1,5,3,1,1,5,1,1,3,3,4,3,4,1,1,2,4,1,1,1,2,3,3,1,1,4,1,4,1,1,1,5,5,1,3,2,5,1982,0,-4,-4,1,-4,88,-4,88,-4,1,-4,2,-4,1,1,-4,744,1,-4,2,11,1981,1,-4,0,-4,-4,1,-4,88,-4,88,-4,12,1,-4,1,-4,-4,0,-4,-4,236,209733,1910,0,1965,1,999,0,211316,1877,0,1958,0,-4,-4,259041,1948,1,-4,0,-4,-4,259142,1946,0,2003,1,48,0,-4,0,-4,1,258948,1972,1,-4,1,40,0,2,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,4,268749,2002,1,-4,0,-4,-4,2,268850,2004,1,-4,0,-4,-4,2,268951,2005,1,-4,0,-4,-4,2,269044,2008,1,-4,0,-4,-4,2,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,;d03145;d04058;d0015,;multivitamin;melatonin;ibuprofen,0,0,0,0,0,0,-4,0,0,0,-4,0,0,0,0,0,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,0,0,0,0,-4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,15,1,888,0,-4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,MBC,1,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,1,0,-4,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,-4,0,0,0,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,0,-4,-4,1,1,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,0,-4,-4,0,-4,-4,0,-4,-4,,,,,,,,,0,,,46,46,0,13,,dp,3,Mutation,-14.89041096,-14.89041096,-16.89041096
